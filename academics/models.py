        shows many-to-many relationship.

        Program and Subject are related through Semester. For example; if we want all the subjects of
        BE Software, then we have to retrieve each Semester of BE Software and from those individual semester,
        we can get the subjects.

        To ease the above process, we introduce the many-to-many relationship between Program and Subject.
        Now we can directly access the subjects of BE Software without joining Semester.
